#!/bin/bash

# Description:
# Ensure that an executable is installed, optionally requiring a minimum
# version. If the executable is not installed, use a package manager to
# install it. Try to avoid re-installing the executable if the only
# problem is broken symlinks. Allowable package managers are brew, gem,
# assert (which will cause the script to exit non-zero if the executable
# is not installed), or any other command (which will be called with no
# arguments).

# Arguments:
# $1 = name of executable that should be installed
# $2 = subcommand to get version (defaults to --version)
# $3 = command name in version command output (defaults to executable name)
# $4 = minimum version (defaults to any-version)
# $5 = package manager (brew, apt-get, gem, assert, or other script; defaults to brew)
# $6 = name of package for package manager (defaults to executable name)

# Preconditions:
# - The package manager must be available on the $PATH.

# Postconditions:
# - An appropriate version of the executable will be available on the $PATH.

# Exit code:
# - zero if no errors occurred;
# - non-zero if an error occurred.
